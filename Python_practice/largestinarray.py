# These are special floating-point values that represent infinity â€”

# "float('inf') and float('-inf') are special values in Python that represent infinity. "
# "They're used as starting points when finding minimum or maximum values, 
# because they guarantee that the first real number you compare will override them.

'''Start with first and second as very small numbers (-inf).

Loop through each number:
If number is bigger than first, move first to second, and update first.
Else, if number is between first and second, update second.
At the end, return second.'''
